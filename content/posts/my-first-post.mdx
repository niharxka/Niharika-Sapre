Getting this to point honestly took a lot of mental resistance and it was a long winded process. I didn't know where to start, felt that I'd be doing in injustice completely relying on LLMs, was confused how to host a blog in a latent way, and the list goes on. 
<br/>
But, at one point I just got fed up of thinking about having a blog and being stuck. I'm gonna have this here as my first iteration.
<br/>
So excited to share my thoughts on a hard-coded website :)
